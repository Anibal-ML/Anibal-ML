# 👋 Hey, I'm Anibal

I'm an Applied Math + Computer Science student at UCLA with a passion for building intelligent systems that connect math, code, and real-world impact.

🔬 **Current Focus:**  
I'm leading an AI-powered coral optimization system — integrating reinforcement learning, computer vision, and sensor-driven data to optimize coral health in controlled ecosystems. This project fuses my background in applied math, ML, and environmental systems, and is being developed for publication.

💻 **What I'm Working On:**
- 🧠 **Coral AI Optimization** — RL + CV + IoT + optimization models  
- 📊 **ML Dashboard** — Full-stack data viz with Python + Plotly  
- 💬 **GPT Negotiation Bot** — NLP-based chatbot with frontend UI  
- 🐶 **Canine Symmetry Analyzer** — OpenCV + facial landmark model

🛠 **Currently:**  
Frontend Developer Intern at **Buuz**, contributing to the design and development of a modern user interface for their marketing and e-commerce platform.

🏋️‍♂️ **Outside of code:** I'm a competitive bodybuilder. Discipline, consistency, and structured growth apply to both lifting and learning — and I bring that mindset into every project I build.
